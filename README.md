## Cracking the Coding Interview

A repo created and maintained by 3 of the finest developers to ever touch a keyboard.

The goal with this repository is to contain our attempts at questions from the book - `Cracking the Coding Interview`

More information on the book can be found - http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/

## Who is involved
There will only be 3 contributors to this repo, Eric, Ian & Johnny. We will be submitting our implementations for 
each question in our preferred languages. (Will add a table with our names and languages later)

## A Special Thank you
A special Thank you must go to Johnny who is behind this initiative. He done something very nice for his two friends
to reignite their love for coding and to prepare them for a successful career ahead.
